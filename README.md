## How to Run
This accepts mouse and mobile inputs.

- Eyes will blink and mouth will move with mouse click.
- Head will 'sleep' and 'typewriter' message is hidden if the mouse cursor leaves the browser window.

>Mobile

- Eyes will reposition upon touch input
- Eyes will blink and mouth will move with touch input

## Future Roadmap
- [x] Integrate mouse click event
- [x] Integrate touch events
