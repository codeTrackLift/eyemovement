    <li>Custom CSS to add a head, hair, and mouth to go with the eyes</li>
    <li>Mouth also moves with mobile and mouse inputs</li>
    <li>Animated head will 'sleep' if mouse leaves the screen</li>
    <li>Custom CSS 'typewriter' message</li>
</ol>

## How to Run
This accepts mouse and mobile inputs.

- Eyes will blink and mouth will move with mouse click.
- Head will 'sleep' and 'typewriter' message is hidden if the mouse cursor leaves the browser window.

>Mobile

- Eyes will reposition upon touch input
- Eyes will blink and mouth will move with touch input

## Future Roadmap
- [x] Integrate mouse click event
- [x] Integrate touch events

This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated at this time.
